# Project:
Automate Process and Analysis of Returns Database Monitoring

# Setup: 
1.  Company with multiple branches
2.  Each branch monitors their returns using a returns database template (excel)
3.  All branch submit their weekly database to a consolidator
4.  Consolidator will merge these excels to single master database and provide insights and analysis

# Process:
1.  Consolidator will save all raw excel files to a folder
2.  Script will Merge all files to master database file
3.  Script also will provide an output that list down all errors found such as inconsistent constants, incorrect formats, etc.
4.  Script provide Top 3 reason for returns
5.  Provide visualizations to findings

# Benefits:
1.  Reduce time allocation on manually cleaning and merging of files to a consolidated database
2.  Increase efficiency of consolidator by focusing on the analysis of output
3.  Eliminate human error that may possibly happen during data processing.
